# Hebrew Sales Call Analysis - Scoring Algorithm Deep Dive

## 🎯 Overview: How the Scoring Algorithm Works

The scoring algorithm is like having a smart assistant that listens to Hebrew sales calls and tells you which customers are most likely to buy. Think of it as a **customer potential detector** that analyzes what people say and how they say it.

### The Big Picture
```
Audio File → Hebrew Transcription → Smart Analysis → Customer Score (0-100)
```

## 🧠 The Four-Pillar Scoring System

The algorithm looks at **four key factors** that indicate whether someone is likely to buy:

### 1. 🚨 **Urgency (30% weight)**
**Question**: "How soon does this person need to buy?"

**What it looks for**:
- Time pressure indicators
- Deadlines and constraints
- Family pressure to buy
- Rental agreements ending

**Why it matters**: People under time pressure are more likely to make quick decisions.

### 2. 💰 **Budget (25% weight)**
**Question**: "Can this person afford to buy?"

**What it looks for**:
- Specific budget amounts
- Approved mortgages
- Cash availability
- Financial readiness signals

**Why it matters**: People with clear budgets and financing are more likely to complete purchases.

### 3. 🎯 **Interest (25% weight)**
**Question**: "How interested is this person in the property?"

**What it looks for**:
- Positive reactions to property details
- Questions about viewing the property
- Expressions of liking the location
- Requests for more information

**Why it matters**: Genuine interest is a strong predictor of purchase intent.

### 4. 💬 **Engagement (20% weight)**
**Question**: "How actively is this person participating in the conversation?"

**What it looks for**:
- Asking questions
- Requesting more details
- Active participation
- Call duration and word count

**Why it matters**: Engaged customers are more likely to move forward in the sales process.

    I --> L[Duration & Word Count Bonus]
```

### Detailed Scoring Logic

#### **Individual Category Scoring**

Each category (Urgency, Budget, Interest, Engagement) is scored from 0-100:

1. **High-Impact Phrases**: +25 points each
2. **Medium-Impact Phrases**: +15 points each
3. **Multiple Match Bonus**: +20 points for 2+ high matches, +10 for 2+ medium matches
4. **Call Metrics Bonus** (for Engagement only):
   - Duration: 5+ min (+25), 3+ min (+20), 2+ min (+15), 1+ min (+10)
   - Word Count: 150+ words (+20), 100+ (+15), 50+ (+10), 25+ (+5)

#### **Overall Score Calculation**

```
Overall Score = (Urgency × 0.30) + (Budget × 0.25) + (Interest × 0.25) + (Engagement × 0.20)
```

**Example**:
- Urgency: 80 points → 80 × 0.30 = 24
- Budget: 70 points → 70 × 0.25 = 17.5
- Interest: 90 points → 90 × 0.25 = 22.5
- Engagement: 85 points → 85 × 0.20 = 17
- **Overall Score**: 24 + 17.5 + 22.5 + 17 = **81 points**

## 🔧 What's Configurable (And Why)
