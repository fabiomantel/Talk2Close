# Hebrew Sales Call Analysis System - User Research & Validation Plan

## Executive Summary

### Elevator Pitch
An AI-powered system that automatically analyzes Hebrew sales calls to identify which customers are most likely to close deals, helping real estate sales teams prioritize their follow-up efforts and increase conversion rates.

### Problem Statement
Real estate sales teams manually analyze 200+ Hebrew voice recordings of sales calls (2-3 minutes each), which is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often misses critical buying signals. This leads to poor prioritization of follow-up efforts and lost opportunities.

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Real estate sales agents and managers in Israel
- **Secondary**: Sales team leaders and operations managers
- **Demographics**: Hebrew-speaking sales professionals, 25-55 years old, working with residential real estate

### Unique Selling Proposition
The only AI-powered system specifically designed for Hebrew sales call analysis with built-in understanding of Israeli real estate market dynamics and Hebrew language nuances.

### Success Metrics
- 80% reduction in manual analysis time
- 20% improvement in deal closure rates
- 90% user adoption within 3 months
- 95% accuracy in customer prioritization

## Feature Specifications

### Feature: User Research & Validation Framework
**User Story**: As a product manager, I want to validate our assumptions with real users, so that we build features that actually solve their problems.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given access to 5-10 sales team members, when we conduct structured interviews, then we have documented insights about their current workflow and pain points
- Given the interview findings, when we analyze the data, then we have validated or invalidated our scoring algorithm assumptions
- Given the research results, when we update the MVP scope, then we have prioritized features by user impact and business value

**Priority**: P0 (Critical) - Blocking success of the entire project
**Dependencies**: Access to sales team members, scheduling coordination
**Technical Constraints**: None (research phase)
**UX Considerations**: Interview format should be user-friendly and non-intimidating
