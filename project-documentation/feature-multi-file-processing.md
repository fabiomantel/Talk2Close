# Multi-File Processing Feature Specification

## Executive Summary

### Feature: Batch Audio File Processing with Interface-Based Architecture
**Elevator Pitch**: Automatically process multiple Hebrew sales call recordings from external folders using a pluggable, interface-based architecture that supports multiple storage providers and notification systems without code changes.

**Problem Statement**: Currently, the system only processes single audio files uploaded through the web interface. Sales teams need to process large batches of recordings stored in external folders without manual upload of each file, enabling automated analysis workflows with extensible storage and notification providers.

**Target Audience**: 
- **Primary**: Sales operations managers and system administrators
- **Secondary**: Sales team leaders who manage bulk call analysis
- **Demographics**: Technical users who manage sales call repositories and batch processing workflows

**Unique Selling Proposition**: The only Hebrew sales call analysis system with a pluggable, interface-based architecture that supports multiple storage providers and notification systems through configuration, enabling easy extension without code changes.

**Success Metrics**:
- **Technical Metrics**: 95%+ batch processing success rate, <30 seconds per file processing time, 99%+ file status tracking accuracy
- **Business Metrics**: 90%+ reduction in manual file handling, 5x increase in processing capacity, 80%+ user satisfaction with batch operations
- **User Experience Metrics**: <5% user error rate in batch operations, 95%+ task completion rate for batch processing

## Feature Specifications

### Feature: Multi-File Processing System
**User Story**: As a sales operations manager, I want to automatically process multiple audio files from external folders with configurable settings, so that I can analyze large batches of sales calls without manual intervention while maintaining full control over processing parameters.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given an external folder with UUID-named audio files, when the system scans the folder, then it identifies new files for processing
- Given identified files, when processing begins, then each file is analyzed with Hebrew transcription and scoring using configurable parameters
- Given processing results, when analysis completes, then customer records are created or updated with analysis data
- Given processing status, when users check the system, then they can see real-time status of all files with detailed error information
- Given failed processing, when errors occur, then the system provides detailed error information, retry capabilities, and configurable alert notifications

**Priority**: P1 (High priority for scaling operations)
**Dependencies**: Existing audio processing pipeline, database schema updates, configuration service extension
**Technical Constraints**: External folder access permissions, file system monitoring capabilities, cloud storage SDK integrations
**UX Considerations**: Clear status visualization, detailed error reporting, comprehensive configuration management, real-time monitoring

## Interface-Based Architecture

### Core Design Principles

1. **Interface Segregation**: Each provider type has a well-defined interface
2. **Dependency Injection**: System uses interfaces, not concrete implementations
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Provider selection and behavior controlled via configuration
4. **Extensibility**: New providers can be added without changing core system
5. **Pluggable Architecture**: Providers can be swapped at runtime via configuration
